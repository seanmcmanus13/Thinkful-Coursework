    "The probability for the first question is 2^4 or 0.0625 as seen below, each time you flip the coin the probability resets. If I was to make a code to predict this I would use a function with a simple if statement. The if statement would calculate the probability of correctly predicting the flips based on the number of sequential flips. This is redundant and over kill, so I haven't done it, but can if I need to."
