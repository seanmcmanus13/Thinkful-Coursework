1stproblem:
SELECT
    trips.trip_id,
	trips.duration,
	trips.start_date,
    weather.precipitationin,
	(CASE WHEN weather.precipitationin > 0 THEN 'rainy' ELSE 'notrainy' END) rainstatus
FROM
    trips 
JOIN
    weather
ON
    trips.zip_code = weather.zip
ORDER BY duration DESC;

--top 3 longest trips on rainy days correspond to trip_id 1011634, 948897, 1068614


2ndproblem:

SELECT
	station_id,
    COUNT(station_id) as station_count,
	docks_available
FROM
    status
GROUP BY 1,3
ORDER BY docks_available ASC, station_count ASC;

--station 4 is full the most often

3rdproblem:

SELECT
    start_station,
    COUNT(start_station) as count_of_starts_from_station,
	s.dockcount
FROM
    trips t
JOIN
    stations s
ON
    t.start_station = s.name
GROUP BY 1, 3
ORDER BY 3 DESC;
