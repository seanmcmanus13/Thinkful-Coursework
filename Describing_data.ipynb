In either case, the standard error isn't really all that meaningful given that, assuming that the mother isn't hyper fertile, she can only have 1 child every 11 months. Due to this, the standard error should tend towards 1 as the mother has more children. This doesn't tell us anything we do not already know. The standard deviation is relatively reflective of the data in this case. All individuals except for Greg and Cindy fall within 1 standard deviation from the mean."
